# Echoes of Time

Project Repository for Echoes of Time

Student project for Game Development at the University of Derby



In the team of 12, we produced coop based puzzle game. This is my first contact with Unreal Engine and I have spent past 5 months learning it. All C++ classes in the project are made by me. Using them I implemented puzzle mechanics. I also implemented most of gameplay mechanics using blueprints.

 * Gained experience with Github, used it in the team environment
 * Developed UE4 abilities like making UI, level streaming, C++ coding, blueprints usage, Blueprint/C++ debugging
